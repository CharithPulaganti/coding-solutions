```db2

/*
    Enter your query here and follow these instructions:
    1. Please append a semicolon ";" at the end of the query and enter your query in a single line to avoid error.
    2. The AS keyword causes errors, so follow this convention: "Select t.Field From table1 t" instead of "select t.Field From table1 AS t"
    3. Type your code immediately after comment. Don't leave any blank line.
*/
SELECT distinct city
From station
WHERE upper(substr(city, 1, 1)) NOT IN ('A','E','I','O','U') AND upper(substr(city, length(city), 1)) NOT IN ('A','E','I','O','U');
